# ✊✋✌️ Rock-Paper-Scissors-Game

A straightforward, interactive **Rock Paper Scissors** game created with **JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS** that brings the beloved hand game to life in a web browser. Players compete against the CPU, with the CPU's selections generated randomly each round.

The game features smooth animations and a user-friendly design. After the player makes a selection—Rock, Paper, or Scissors—the CPU randomly picks its option, and both selections are revealed with dynamic shake animations to build suspense. The interface then shows the winner according to the traditional game rules.
